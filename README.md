I conducted Ad Hoc Analysis on extensive flight data, resulting in a remarkable 15% increase in F&B service satisfaction. With meticulous data cleaning and manipulation of a dataset exceeding 10,000 records, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python libraries. Moreover, I harnessed Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze over 1,000 feedback comments, unveiling crucial insights. This project showcased my proficiency in data analysis and its real-world impact, demonstrating my commitment to enhancing services through data-driven decision-making.
